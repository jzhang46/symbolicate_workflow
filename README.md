You can also add a shortcut for the symbolication:

Note: 
  1. Symbols files could be placed anywhere searchable by spotlight.
  2. You can select multiple files at a time.
  3. After symbolicating the file(s), it will open the result file by TextEdit.
  4. The result file(s) is stored at the same folder as the .crash file(s), named with .symbolized.crash extension.
